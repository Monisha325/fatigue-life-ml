## 📊 Model Evaluation Comparison

### 🔹 Overall Performance

| Metric    | EfficientNet-B0 | DenseNet-121 |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Accuracy   | 0.8733 (87%)    | 0.8649 (86%) |
| Precision  | 0.8786 (88%)    | 0.8658 (86%) |
| Recall     | 0.8733 (87%)    | 0.8649 (86%) |
| F1-score   | 0.8712 (87%)    | 0.8624 (86%) |

### 🔹 Confusion Matrix (EfficientNet-B0)
```text

### 🔹 Weighted Classification Summary

| Model            | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|------------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| EfficientNet-B0  | 0.88      | 0.87   | 0.87     |
| DenseNet-121     | 0.87      | 0.86   | 0.86     |

## 🏆 Final Model Selection

EfficientNet-B0 was selected as the final deployment model because it consistently achieved higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score compared to DenseNet-121.

Since recall is critical in medical diagnosis to minimize false negatives, EfficientNet’s higher recall and balanced performance
